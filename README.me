Kuongshun AD177 Turtle Robot – ESP32

This project contains early firmware for the Kuongshun AD177 Turtle Robot using an ESP32. The code is modular, separating motors and line sensors, and implements basic line avoidance logic.

Note: The code is a work in progress and not yet complete. Further improvements and behaviors will be added.

Features (so far):
- Forward and backward movement based on the center line sensor.
- Motor control using PWM for smoother speed management.
- Modular structure for easier development.
